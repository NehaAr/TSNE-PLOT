# TSNE-PLOT

In this code , we would learn how to construct TSNE plot and understand the steps required to follow that.

The Dataset used over here is proteomic dataset and the platform used is Google Colab

TSNE is a dimesionality reduction technique , used for non linear datasets. 

My dataset had 7 features , of which three were categorical nd 4 were numerical. TSNE is not possible for categorical columns , hence they required to be converted into numerical.
